# Brain_Tumor_Detection_Localization
Brain Tumor Detection and Localization using Deep Learning

The project entails the development of a brain tumor detection and localization system using deep learning techniques, specifically employing ResNet for classification and ResUNet for segmentation, trained on MRI brain scans with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) which is available online readily.
